            <h1>About the Experience</h1>
            <section>
                General
                <p>
                    My experience of working on this project has been very
                    intresting and in return I have learnt some valuable skills
                    that has helped me in my self confidence. The biggest
                    positive to take out of the whole experience is coming out
                    with a product that will help me get good marks in the exam.
                    On the negative side time consumption with limited
                    experience sometimes made it really difficult.

                    Positive
                    <p>
                        The biggest positive to take out of the whole experience
                        is coming out with a product that will help me get good
                        marks in the exam. It is also a good feeling to see
                        different things work togheter and how a single command
                        can create anything from a small change something big.

                    Negative
                    <p>
                        The biggest negative for was the limited experince and
                        effect of that on the progress. Making a simple syntax
                        error would sometimes take hours to figure and trying to
                        scroll through notes hindered the progress as well made
                        a dent on the motivation to keep moving forward.

                    Development
                    <p>
                        From start of the term to where I am know, i have learnt
                        alot however, i do feel that my work could be much
                        better than where it is right now. My intial designs
                        were very basic for the website, but i did try to build
                        on it slowly and hopefully the final product would be
                        good.
