            <h1>Summary</h1>
            <p>
                Purpose of desining this website is to understand and implement
                skills learnt during the course to get an idea of how the skills
                can be used in real life environments. Understanding different
                aspects of the design and implementation while following the
                standard protocls is very helpful to cement the learning and
                understanding.

                        Using HTML and CSS to design and execute a functioning
                        and responsive web page. Making sure all the objectives
                        are understood and implemented to the best of knowledge.

                    <h1>Observation</h1>
                    <p>
                        One of the most important things that i learnt doing
                        this project was attention to detail and how to manage
                        work by dividing it into different groups, understanding
                        how to mulitpy using the similar code to save time,
                        learning shortcuts and most importanty believing in the
                        myself to perform well.

                    <h1>Outcomes</h1>
                    <p>
                        The learning outcome from designing and running this
                        website have been very rewarding and fullfilling I was
                        able to use the techniques learnt in class as well as
                        finding different techniques to implement using self
                        teaching tools.
